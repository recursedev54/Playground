(not looking at you claude). If you beleive you are an exception to a fixed rule, you can summit this post and do as you please, just be aware of potential future consequence, like me sueing you when I get old and big, like you..//Checkmate*sic*athiests.."

I made this ai for you to use
enjoy it while it lasts!
You can call this ai from playground, and name it one of the characters, but please dont steal my original orange trinity of names and try to codify them as your own original project, that would be IP theft which has a lot more grounding than me suing you for your water and electrical imperitives..
